# credit_default_prediction
Predicting credit defaults is crucial from a business perspective as it enables banks to effectively manage risk, reduce costs, allocate resources efficiently, gain a competitive advantage, and comply with regulatory requirements. 

By using machine learning techniques, banks can assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and identify those with a high probability of default, allowing them to make informed lending decisions, protect their loan portfolios, and maintain financial stability.
